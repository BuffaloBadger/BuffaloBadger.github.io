    "text": "ToTaL PS is a blog I created to share my “Thoughts on Teaching and Learning Problem-Solving,” (ToTaL PS). “Problem-Solving” can have multiple meanings. Here the focus is actually on undergraduate college level science and engineering problem-solving courses. For the purposes of this blog, these are courses where the professor presents theory and equations and shows how to use the theory and apply the equations to explain and predict how some physical system performs. Most, if not all, of the student learning outcomes for this type of problem-solving course center on the learner being able to use the theory and equations to answer questions about the performance of systems to which they apply.\nThe problems in these courses are often referred to as “word problems” or “story problems.” Typically they consist of a few paragraphs that describe a system and provide information about how it is being operated. Then they ask one or more questions about how the system performs or how the system should be operated to achieve some desired performance. The problems can be classified as response, optimization or design problems. In a response problem the system and the way it is operated are specified and the question asks the student to determine the value of a specific input, output or system parameter. Optimization problems typically involve questions asking for specification of one or more system properties or operating parameters that maximize or minimize some other specified system output or response. Design problems differ in that they allow the problem-solver to make choices about one or more system properties or operating parameters with the goal of achieving or optimizing a specified system response. Optimization and design problems may also be constrained. In a constrained problem restrictions are placed upon the allowed answers to the questions being asked. Problems can also be classified as being open-ended or not. An open-ended problem has more than one “correct” answer. Design problems are open-ended, and optimization problems can be. In contrast, a problem that is not open-ended has a single answer that is correct. Most response problems are not open-ended.\nAnother characteristic of the kind of problem-solving courses that this blog focuses upon is that the students are assigned homework problems or sets of homework problems. In principle, these homework problems align with the course learning objectives. That is, when a learner can solve one of these problems correctly, it is an indicator that the learner has fulfilled one of the course learning objectives. Beyond homework problems, problem-solving courses very often use exams to evaluate the degree to which students have achieved the course learning objectives. As with homework problems, the problems included in exams typically align with the course learning objectives.\nI have been teaching problem-solving courses like the one I’ve described here since 1980. Before that, I was a student in many problem-solving courses. Over the years I’ve used different course structures, teaching methods, modes of evaluation, etc. Some of them worked and some didn’t. I’ve also used different approaches to learn myself, and observed students using a variety of learning approaches. Again, some learing strategies are more effective than others.\nIn more recent years, I’ve done some applied research on teaching and learning in problem-solving courses. So I decided to start this blog as a place where I can share my thoughts and experiences in case someone might be interested. I expect that most posts will be introduced from an instructor’s perspective, but I intend to discuss them from the perspectives of learners and instructors. Hopefully there will be some useful, or at least thought-provoking, information for both."

    "text": "This page is a placeholder.\nReaction Engineering Basics is a book I am writing. When it gets closer to being finished, this page will be taken down, and the link you followed to get here will instead take you to the actual book.\nIn the mean time, here’s an excerpt from the Preface and the Table of Contents:\n\n\n\n\nReaction Engineering Basics is an introductory textbook on chemical kinetics and reaction engineering. There are many excellent introductory kinetics and reaction engineering textbooks. Like many other textbooks, Reaction Engineering Basics, limits kinetics data analysis problems to isothermal systems with a single reaction taking place (though it does not limit the analysis to systems where linear least squares can be used). However, as it moves into the area of reaction engineering, Reaction Engineering Basics is different from many other textbooks in two respects. First, Reaction Engineering Basics does not start with systems with single reactions taking place in isothermal reactors and then introduce systems with multiple reactions or systems requiring an energy balance in subsequent chapters. The reaction engineering section of Reaction Engineering Basics starts with systems that require mole and energy balances and that feature multiple reactions. Second, Reaction Engineering Basics differs from many other introductory kinetics and reaction engineering textbooks by using numerical methods to solve almost all of the problems it presents. The one exception is that analytic algebra is used when generating rate expressions for non-elementary reactions from proposed mechanisms for those reactions.\nReaction Engineering Basics was written for use in an undergraduate chemical engineering curriculum. The intended audience is students who have completed approximately two years of a four-year chemical engineering degree program. While very brief overviews of important topics are included, generally Reaction Engineering Basics assumes that readers have completed two semesters of general chemistry, a course on chemical engineering mass and energy balances and, ideally, a course on chemical engineering thermodynamics. Proficiency in algebra, calculus and differential equations is also assumed.\n\n\nPreface\nBasic Information\n\\(\\quad\\) 1. Reactions, Reactors and Reaction Engineering\n\\(\\quad\\) 2.

    "text": "Hi! My name is Carl Lund. I’m a Wisconsin Badger fan and UW Chemical Engineering alum living in Buffalo, NY. I’m also a professor of Chemical Engineering at the University at Buffalo. One of the courses I teach is an undergraduate course on chemical kinetics and reaction engineering. It’s a typical engineering problem-solving course that I’ve been teaching since 1986. During that time, I’ve revised and refined the methods I use when teaching it, trying to make student learning easier and more efficient.\nThinking that perhaps my thoughts and experiences over the 35-plus years I’ve been teaching problem-solving courses might be useful to others who do the same, I decided to blog about it. So this site is the home of the BuffaloBadger’s ToTaL PS blog. “ToTaL PS” stands for Thoughts on Teaching and Learning Problem Solving, and I’m the BuffaloBadger.\nYears ago I created a site with resources for the kinetics and reaction engineering course I teach. I’m now about half way through the process of creating a book based on those materials. The book will be titled Reaction Engineering Basics. When it gets closer to being completed, I will add it to this site. At present there is only a placeholder page for it.\nAfter I complete Reaction Engineering Basics, I plan to create an online self-study course based upon it. When it is ready, it will be added to this site, too.\nHope you get inspired or learn something while visiting here!\nHorns Up and On Wisconsin!"
