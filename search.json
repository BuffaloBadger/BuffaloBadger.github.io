    "text": "Hi! My name is Carl Lund. I’m a Wisconsin Badger fan and UW Chemical Engineering alum living in Buffalo, NY. I’m also a professor of Chemical Engineering at the University at Buffalo. One of the courses I teach is an undergraduate course on chemical kinetics and reaction engineering. It’s a typical engineering problem-solving course that I’ve been teaching since 1986. During that time, I’ve revised and refined the methods I use when teaching it, trying to make student learning easier and more efficient.\nThinking that perhaps my thoughts and experiences over the 35-plus years I’ve been teaching problem-solving courses might be useful to others who do the same, I decided to blog about it. So this site is the home of the BuffaloBadger’s ToTaL PS blog. “ToTaL PS” stands for Thoughts on Teaching and Learning Problem Solving, and I’m the BuffaloBadger.\nYears ago I created a site with resources for the kinetics and reaction engineering course I teach. I’m now about half way through the process of creating a book based on those materials. The book is titled Reaction Engineering Basics. Even though it is still being written, I’ve added it to this site, making available the parts for which a first draft has been completed.\nAfter I complete Reaction Engineering Basics, I plan to create an online self-study course based upon it. Eventually that, too, will be added to this site.\nHope you get inspired or learn something while visiting here!\nHorns Up and On Wisconsin!"

    "text": "This page is a placeholder.\nReaction Engineering Basics is a book I am writing. When it gets closer to being finished, this page will be taken down, and the link you followed to get here will instead take you to the actual book.\nIn the mean time, here’s an excerpt from the Preface and the Table of Contents:\n\n\n\n\nReaction Engineering Basics is an introductory textbook on chemical kinetics and reaction engineering. There are many excellent introductory kinetics and reaction engineering textbooks. Like many other textbooks, Reaction Engineering Basics, limits kinetics data analysis problems to isothermal systems with a single reaction taking place (though it does not limit the analysis to systems where linear least squares can be used). However, as it moves into the area of reaction engineering, Reaction Engineering Basics is different from many other textbooks in two respects. First, Reaction Engineering Basics does not start with systems with single reactions taking place in isothermal reactors and then introduce systems with multiple reactions or systems requiring an energy balance in subsequent chapters. The reaction engineering section of Reaction Engineering Basics starts with systems that require mole and energy balances and that feature multiple reactions. Second, Reaction Engineering Basics differs from many other introductory kinetics and reaction engineering textbooks by using numerical methods to solve almost all of the problems it presents. The one exception is that analytic algebra is used when generating rate expressions for non-elementary reactions from proposed mechanisms for those reactions.\nReaction Engineering Basics was written for use in an undergraduate chemical engineering curriculum. The intended audience is students who have completed approximately two years of a four-year chemical engineering degree program. While very brief overviews of important topics are included, generally Reaction Engineering Basics assumes that readers have completed two semesters of general chemistry, a course on chemical engineering mass and energy balances and, ideally, a course on chemical engineering thermodynamics. Proficiency in algebra, calculus and differential equations is also assumed.\n\n\nPreface\nBasic Information\n\\(\\quad\\) 1. Reactions, Reactors and Reaction Engineering\n\\(\\quad\\) 2.

    "title": "Goal Structure",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In my July 3, 2023 post I suggested that the manner in which homework is presented can affect the way a student approaches completing a problem-solving assignment. Then in my July 18, 2023 post I described four goal orientations that influence the manner in which a student completes a problem-solving assignment. I described four achievement goal orientations that students may hold. Students with a performance approach goal orientation seek to demonstrate their ability. In problem-solving this can translate getting the correct answer being the goal. Learners with a mastery approach goal orientation seek to develop their ability. In problem-solving this can translate to knowing how to solve the problem. Students with a performance avoidance goal orientation seek to avoid demonstrating their inability. In problem-solving this can again translate to getting the correct answer as the goal. Finally students with a mastery avoidance goal orientation seek to avoid missing an opportunity to develop their ability. In problem-solving this can translate to knowing how to solve every variant of a given type of problem.\nSo if a student’s goal orientation influences how they approach a problem-solving assignment, and if the manner in which homework is presented can affect the student’s approach, it remains to relate the manner in which homework is presented to the goal orientation a student adopts. That is where goal structure comes in. In a nutshell, through their experiences in a course, students perceive a course goal structure. Perceived goal structure parallels achievement goal orientation. Students will perceive a performance approach, mastery approach, performance avoidance, or mastery avoidance goal structure. The goal structure a student perceives in a given course influences the goal orientation they adopt, and as already discussed, this affects their approach to assignments in the course. I think it is important to notice that goal structure is a perception. Different students taking the same course may perceive different goal structures. In part, that is because no two students have the exact same experiences while taking a course.\nI tend to think about the linkages between what I do as an instructor and the extent to which the course learning objectives are met in terms of Figure 1. Starting with the instructor, shown in orange, I set the learning objectives for the course, and the manner in which I convey the information and teach the skills necessary to meet them clearly can affect the learning outcomes (how fully each student meets the objectives). I also play a role in establishing the course environment, and this is what I will focus on later in the post. However, it is critically important to recognize that I do not have exclusive control of either the course environment or the learning outcomes. There are many other factors that shape the course environment and learning outcomes.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Indirect linkage between teaching and learning outcomes.\n\n\nThe blue box in the figure is meant to convey that a student’s perception of the course goal structure and the goal orientation they adopt are internal to that student. I cannot change either of them directly. Instead, as the figure suggests, I can only try to establish a course environment that will be perceived as a mastery approach goal structure. I’ve already noted that each student’s goal orientation will affect the learning behaviors that they employ (right side of the figure). I can try to influence those learning behaviors (dashed orange arrow) by suggesting effective ways to study, etc. but ultimately learning behavior is under the student’s control. Again, there are a variety of other factors that will also impact the learning behaviors that the student ultimately employs. If I do a good job of conveying the necessary knowledge and skills and the student utilizes adaptive learning behaviors, the learning outcomes should meet or exceed the learning objectives.\nThis is the basis for my previous claim that the manner in which homework is presented can affect the way a student approaches completing a problem-solving activity. However, the way homework is presented is just one part of the course environment. If I alter the way I present homework assignments in ways suggesting a mastery approach goal structure, but every other aspect of the course environment suggests, for example, a performance approach goal structure, I can’t expect my alterations to be effective. It is necessary to holistically address the course environment if I hope to influence student goal orientations.\nBut for now, let’s just look at homework and how it is presented. The first thing to decide is what purpose or purposes you want the homework to serve. It is OK to use homework assignments as a means of assessing learning outcomes. I personally don’t think it is a very effective or accurate means of assessment, but as long as the students have opportunities to practice, fail and learn from their mistakes before being assessed, it is OK to use homework in this way. Students should be advised of the purpose of the assignment. I think many instructors think of homework as both a practice/learning activity and an assessment. If that’s the intended purpose, it is important to emphasize to the students that the homework is intended to be a practice/learning acitivty. To me this is a kind of mixed messaging that could result in a mastery-approach goal structure, but that is more likely to yield a performance approach goal structure.\nIn my problem-solving course the purpose of homework is completely for practice, learning, and self-assessment. I have found that if homework is optional, many students do not complete it. Therefore I “grade” homework assignments on effort and not on whether the correct answer was obtained. I give the solution to the problem to the students as a part of the assignment. I tell them to try to solve the problem as if they are taking an exam, and to only refer to the solution if they get stuck. They are instructed to compare their solution to the one I provided after they have completed the assignment to make sure they completed it correctly. I then ask them to write a brief reflection on the state of their understanding of that particular type of assignment and to identify things they can do if their understanding is not yet fully developed.\nI believe that taken together, this way of presenting homework sends a clear message that the purpose of homework is to learn how to solve problems. I often point out that if they know how to solve a problem, then they will get the correct answer, but if they get the correct answer by using non-adaptive learning behaviors, they may not know how to solve the problem independently. This presentation of homework is one of many things I do in my problem-solving course to try to establish a course environment that is perceived by students as a mastery-approach goal structure."

    "title": "Book Review: How Learning Works",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2013 I attended a conference on the future of engineering education. It brought together a number of engineering professors who were interested in improving the way engineers are educated in the U. S. I have the sense that like me, most in attendance did not have any formal training in education. One of the speakers noted that he, too, began conducting education research with no formal training in education. He said that a book by Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro, Lovett and Norman was tremendously helpful when he was getting started. That book is “How Learning Works, 7 Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching1.”\n“How Learning Works, 7 Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching” provides a nice summary of research related to how people learn. It is conveniently organized, starting with an introduction where the authors present seven principles of how people learn that have emerged from decades of research on the topic. The principles are (1) students’ prior learning can help or hinder learning, (2) how students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know, (3) students’ motivation generates, directs and sustains what they do to learn, (4) to develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them and know when to apply what they have learned, (5) goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning, (6) students’ current level of development interacts with the social, emotional and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning, and (7) to become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.\nThat introductory chapter is followed by seven chapters that each focus on one of the seven principles I just listed. These seven chapters are all structured the same way. They begin with two short vignettes. In each vignette a professor describes something they experienced in an actual classroom. The chapter then proceeds to analyze what was going on in each vignette, showing how that chapter’s learning principle applies. A nice summary of related research literature and findings that support the principle follows. Each of these chapters next presents strategies, based on that literature, that might be used in the situations described in the vignettes. Each of these chapters concludes with a summary. Following the seven chapters focused on the learning principles, an overall conclusion is presented.\nThe back portion of the book has eight appendices and a comprehensive list of references. The appendices describe things that might help address an issue related to one of the learning principles. They all begin with “What is,” or “What are.” For example, Appendix F is titled “What are Exam Wrappers and How Can We Use Them.” The subjects of the other appendices are student self-assessment, concept maps, rubrics, learning objectives, ground rules, checklists and reader response/peer review.\nI have found myself going back to this book repeatedly since I first read it. I highly recommend “How Learning Works.” You don’t need to be an educational specialist to read and understand it. It’s a great and accessible way for teachers and students alike to broaden their understanding of how learning works."

    "title": "Achievement Goals",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this post, I’d like to build on the suggestion in my last post that the manner in which homework is presented can affect the way a student approaches completing the homework assignment. When a student undertakes a task, such as a homework assignment, there is something they hope to accomplish by completing it. The thing they hope to accomplish can be called an achievement goal. Achievement goal theory categorizes achievement goals, describes their origins, and explains their consequences. (Many good reviews on achievement goal theory are available, for example1 2.)\nAccording to achievement goal theory, students may hold one of four achievement goal orientations. These are called performance approach, mastery approach, performance avoidance and mastery avoidance goal orientations. A student with a performance approach goal orientation wants to demonstrate their ability. In the context of solving homework problems in an engineering problem-solving course, I believe that this translates to a goal of getting the correct answer. In contrast, a student holding a mastery approach goal orientation wants to develop their ability. In terms of solving homework problems, I think of this goal as wanting to know how to get the correct answer.\nA student holding a performance avoidance goal orientation approaches a task with the goal of not performing more poorly than others. In a problem-solving course this might translate to a goal of not getting the wrong answer. In my limited reading in the area, mastery avoidance goal orientations are not as well defined as the other orientaions. A mastery avoidance goal might be to avoid being unable to get the correct answer, but it also could mean completing a task to avoid losing the knowledge of how to get the correct answer.\nThe goal orientation that a student adopts has a direct impact upon the learning behaviors they exhibit. From a teaching perspective, it is desirable for students to adopt a mastery approach goal orientation. Students with a mastery approach goal orientation want to know what to do to solve a problem and they want to understand why they need to do it. Understanding why they perform a given sequence of steps to solve a problem is expected to lead to more persistent knowledge, and it is expected to be more easily transferrable to solving future problems.\nStudents who adopt a performace approach goal orientation may exhibit less desirable learning behaviors because their goal is focused upon the answer and not the path to the answer. For example, a student with a performance approach goal orientation may be more likely to employ a mimicry approach to problem solving. They find a solved problem that appears to be similar to the problem at hand and then mimick the approach used to solve that problem. If the goal is getting the correct answer, this is the most efficient route, short of copying. Over time as more and more problems are solved, these students will know how to solve the type of problem at hand. However, it is not an efficient approach to developing understanding.\nAnother undesirable learning behavior that can result from a performance approach goal orientation is not using feedback. Feedback is provided after the student has either demonstrated they can get the correct answer or failed to do so. In terms of their goal, reading comments on their work or comparing their solution to one that is correct won’t change their goal outcome. Similarly, students who adopt a performance avoidance goal orientation may compare their solution to a correct one, but in doing so, they are often looking for places where they can “get a few points back,” and not looking to understand what they did wrong.\nSo in this post I’ve described some relationships between a student’s achievement goal orientation and the learning behaviors they display. I noted that the achievement goal orientation they hold may affect how they approach doing their homework assignments. This was necessary before I can talk about how the manner in which homework is presented can affect their approach. That will be my next topic, but here’s a brief preview. In their courses, students perceive a course goal structure with the same four types of goals. The course environment, e. g. the way homework is presented, influences the goal structure they perceive which affects the goal orientation they adopt which impacts the learning behaviors they employ."

    "title": "In-Class Practice",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In many ways, the ideal time and place for students to practice problem solving is during class. Many years ago I converted my problem-solving course to a flipped classroom format, but even before that, I started incorporating “Learning Activities” into my lectures. Instead of presenting the solution of a problem in class, I would assign the reading of a problem solution from the textbook to be completed before the class met. Then in place of presenting that solution in class, I instead had the class work through the solution to a similar problem as an in-class activity. If a solved problem is available that presents the solver’s thinking as they solve the problem that’s a great solution to assign for before class. If no such solution is available, as is often the case, I would encourage the students to write brief questions whenever they didn’t understand why the person solving the problem did what they did, or how the person solving the problem knew how to do what they did.\nIn my course, we typically spend several class meetings considering a given type of problem, so there are multiple opportunities for learning activities for a given problem type. Before we start each of these learning activities I remind the students of its purpose. I emphasize that the goal of the learning activity is for them to learn how to solve that type of problem, not getting the correct answer. I typically point out that getting the correct answer will occur naturally if they know how to approach solving the problem.\nI repeatedly point out that getting stuck during one of the in-class learning activities is the best thing that can happen to them. I tell them that when they get stuck they have either identified a point where they don’t know what to do or they’ve found something they don’t know how to do. I tell them that this is the purpose of the activity, because as soon as they identify that point, I’m right there to help them get unstuck. In fact, I generally encourage the students to work together with those sitting close to them as we progress through the activity, because often times, a student will more easily understand the explanation of a point from a classmate than they will my explanation. These activities are a good opportunity to attempt to establish a mastery-approach goal structure in the class by emphasizing that their objective during the activity should be to learn how to solve that type of problem and not to show me or their classmates that they got the correct answer.\nIn my last post, I argued that students need to practice more than how to solve a given problem. They need to practice identifying a problem’s type, they need to practice knowing which of the skills and knowledge they have acquired to use for a given problem type, they need to practice knowing the general approach for using those skllls and knowledge, and only after that do they need to practice actually solving the problem. For this reason, when I first show the problem statement, I start almost every learning activity with a question along the following lines.\n\nOkay, in today’s class we are studying [isolated ideal reactor modeling] problems, so you can be pretty sure that is a [isolated reactor modeling] problem. But supose that this was an exam covering the past six weeks of the course. How would you know that his is a [isolated reactor modeling] problem and not a [kinetics data analysis] problem or one of the other types of problems we’ve studied previously.\n\nOnce I get some responses and we’ve noted the distinguishing characteristics of the problem at hand that allow its identification, the next question I almost always ask is “what is the general approach for solving a [isolated reactor modeling] problem?” We then spend a few minutes outlining the general approach for solving the problem. Note that both the identification of the problem type and the general approach for solving it would have been presented earlier in this class and/or in previous classes.\nFrom this point on, we walk through that general approach for solving this type of problem, applying it to the specific problem in the learning activity. The first time we solve a given type of problem in a learning activity, the solution steps are highly scaffolded. That is, I list each step and then direct them how to complete it. This scaffolding is then gradually removed in subsequent learning activities that involve that same type of problem. By the last learning activity on that type of problem, I may only ask them how they know what type of problem it is and what is the general approach for solving it, after which I’ll simply tell them to jump in and solve it.\nUsed properly (and with buy-in from the students) I think these learning activities are the best way for students to practice, The biggest drawback is that time is limited, but having an expert there to get them un-stuck immediately is tremendously valuable. There are two other things that I think are very important.\nThe first is to walk among students as they work and not just stand at the front of the room. I find that students are more likely to ask me a question one-on-one as I stroll past them than they are to raise their hand and ask their question for whole class to hear. (When they are that brave, I always try to praise them for asking!)\nThe second important thing is that I provide a written solution. Due to the limited time available, some students likely won’t fully process the solution as we proceed through it in class. When I prepare this written solution, I eliminate the questions and the scaffolding, replacing them with factual statements that highlight my thinking. For example, in place of the learing activity question, ““how would you know this is an isolated reactor modeling problem?”, I might write “I can see that this is an isolated reactor modeling problem because….”\nIn my next post I’ll examine some other forms of practice, but as I said, I think in-class learning activities can offer the highest quality problem-solving practice."

    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the seven research-based principles of “How Learning Works”1 states that “To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them and know when to apply what they have learned.” Another says “Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning.” So two of seven priciples that are central to learning refer to the need for practice. One might then ask “What constitutes practice?”.\nIn a problem-solving course, homework can be a great opportunity for a student to practice. Previously, I’ve stated my opinion that homework that is graded and counts toward a student’s final course grade is not true practice. Yes, the student does need to go through the process of solving the problem, but their focus will likely be split. They know that they need to learn how to solve the type of problem they have been assigned, but they also know that their course grade depends upon the acccuracy of their solution.\nIn terms of goal structure, graded homework is at best split between making performance approach goals (getting the correct answer) and mastery approach goals (knowing how to get the correct answer) salient. Based upon the prevalence of outright copying (from a student or from an online source of the solution) and a mimicry approach to completing an assignment (mimic a solution to a, hopefully, similar problem), I suspect that graded homework establishes more of a performance approach goal structure than one of mastery approach.\nIndeed, I suspect that many students don’t think that deeply about it, and that they assume that they are learning when they utilize one of those approaches. They probably are learning to some extent, but using those approaches is not an efficient way to achieve problem-solving mastery.\nNow I’m not saying that graded homework is necessarily bad, but I do feel very strongly that any graded homework on a given type of problem should be preceded by ungraded opportunities to practice solving that type of problem. Before their ability is assessed, students should have the opportunity to attempt to solve a problem type, fail, and learn from their failure.\nI like sports. If you look in the record books for NFL quarterbacks, their pass completion percentage factors in only the passes they attempted during games. The amount of time they spend practicing football is probably ten or more times greater than the amount of time they spend playing actual games. They undoubtedly throw many, many more passes in practice than they throw in games. In practice they can try something new, and if it seems promising, they can develop it. They can also make mistakes and learn from them. (Coaching, i. e. targeted feedback can play a big role here, but that’s a topic for another day). The key point I’m making is that none of the passes they attempt during practice are included in their official pass completion percentage.\nTaking it a step further, those NFL quarterbacks have already thrown thousands of passes before they ever got to the NFL, and still, their practice passes (homework grades) are not included in their official statistics (final course grade). Students taking a problem-solving course may never have attempted a given problem type prior to a given homework assignment. They deserve the opportunity to throw a few passes in practice before they are put into a game where their completions will count toward their official completion percentage.\nSo what constitutes practice? In a problem-solving course, I’d say practice is an opportunity for a student to try to solve the same kind of problem that they will eventually be graded on. It’s an opportunity to “get stuck,” and thereby to identify and correct something they had not yet fully understood. It’s an opportunity to complete an assignment thinking they had “aced” it, only to learn that one of the steps they had taken was completely wrong and should have been done differently. It’s the opportunity to learn from all of those things without getting penalized."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s been a long time since I was a student in an engineering problem-solving course. I do remember that I was assigned a lot of homework problems, but I don’t recall spending any time consciously thinking about what its purpose was. The professor assigned it, and the score that I earned by submitting it represented some fraction of my final grade in the course. I don’t reccollect any of my professors ever telling me what was the purpose of the homework they assigned. (Some of them may have done so; if they did it went in one ear and out the other.) Reflecting back to those times, I believe that subconsciously I figured that the purpose of homework was to show the professor that I could solve the problems they assigned. In other words, I pretty much considered homework to be a form of evaluation or assessment of my learning.\nThere are at least three problems with that mind-set. First, my goal when solving the problems was to get the correct answer because that was the basis upon which the homework was graded. I was a student before the internet existed, so I couldn’t go online hoping to find the solution to the problem to make sure I got it right. Some fraternities and sororities on campus had files of old exam and homework solutions, but I didn’t have access to any of those, either. So I pretty much ended up solving the problems myself, but when I was done, I’m quite certain that I checked with classmates to see if they got the same answer, and if they didn’t, we’d sit down and try to determine which of us was correct and then revise the incorrect solution.\nI’m very confident that when I solved those problems, I did so primarily by mimicry. That is, I found an example that was solved in the textbook or my class notes, and then I mimicked that solution to get an answer to the problem I’d been assigned. In short, and in part because my goal was to get the correct answer, the second problem with my mindset on the purpose of homework was that I missed opportunities to expand or deepen my knowledge through solving the problems independently. More critically I missed the opportunity to develop my independent problem-solving skills. Those skills evolved gradually, as over time I started to remember how the problems were solved in the solutions I mimicked. It certainly wasn’t the most efficient way to learn how to solve the problems.\nThe third problem relates to feedback. Now to be honest, not much feedback was actually provided. Most of the time, a “correct” solution was posted somewhere (again, pre-internet, so probably inside some glass enclosed bulletin board), and my returned homework may have had some marks. Usually, though the marks were simply a red “X” through an equation or value that was incorrect. It didn’t really matter that much, though, because with my perspective on the purpose of homework (show the professor I could solve the problems they assigned), checking my solution came after the fact and wouldn’t change the result. I think I usually checked “to see what I got wrong” in the hope that I’d remember it when exam time came and not make the same mistake. I didn’t engage in any metacognitive thinking, though, to try to identify flaws in my study habits or to consider whether I knew how to approach the problem. As I said, I solved the problem by mimicry, so the approach I used wasn’t really mine, anyway.\nThe point of this post isn’t to reveal the purpose of homework in a problem-solving course. Homework can serve several purposes. The point is that the purpose for the homework that I (mostly subconsciously) inferred had a significant influence on the methods I used to solve the problem. My next few posts will take a closer look at how the way homework is presented can affect the way students approach it."

    "title": "A Waste of Time",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I don’t know if this is very widely practiced today, but I can remember problem-solving courses that I took where we were not provided with any equations on exams. We were told we should memorize any equations we might need. In my opinion, it is a total waste of a student’s time to require them to memorize equations for an exam. Here are a few reasons why.\nThe time a student spends memorizinng equations, instead could be spent making sure they know how to use those equations. Is the goal of the course to know equations or to know how to use them?\nIn my own professional life, there are some equations that I just know. That’s because I use them all the time, not because I consciously attempted to memorize them. More importantly, when I have a problem to solve, I don’t rely on my memory of an equation. If I have the slightest doubt, I pull out a text or reference book and make sure I have the equation written correctly. In fact, I could argue that it is more important for a student to know where to find an equation than it is to have it memorized. Why force a student to solve a problem using equations pulled from their memory if practicing engineers don’t do so?\nMemorizing an equation has no lasting impact. If they don’t use the equation regularly, they will eventually forget it. Going back to how people learn, one of the principles is that to develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them and know when to apply what they have learned. Yes, it is important to know the equation (or at least that it exists), but for lasting impact it is equally important to know when to use it and to have practiced doing so.\nIf students are expected to memorize equations, doing so should be listed as one of the course objectives, and that raises another problem. If memorizing equations is a course objective, then it should be assessed separately from other course objectives. If the only evaluation of whether a student has memorized an equation is putting a problem that requires its use on an exam, the the evaluation is likely flawed. Presumably there is also a course objective that the student is able to solve problems that require its use. A student could fail to solve this exam problem because (a) they failed to memorize the equation, in part or in whole, (b) they do not know how to use the equation or (c) they are unable to integrate other necessary knowledge into their solution. So unless the grading of the exam problem is very detailed, the problem will not facilitate the separate assessment of any one of the learning objectives.\nNow if you are a student reading this, you are pretty much out of luck with respect to having to memorize equations. If your instructor requires it, it doesn’t matter that I think its a waste of time, you still need to memorize the equations. One thing I sometimes found useful in this situation was knowing how to derive the equation instead of memorizing it. This can be useful in two ways. First, if it is a simple derivation, it may be more efficient to just derive it on an exam. Even if the derivation is more involved, knowing the derivation can help, for example, if you can’t remember whether a given term is positive or negative. Knowing how it is derived may make it clear to you.\nBack to the instructors in the crowd, what are the alternatives to requiring students to memorize equations? One I’ve seen used is to allow the students to make a one-page (or x-page) “cheat sheet” that they are allowed to use during each exam. One issue with this approach is that they can include a lot more than just equations on such a cheat sheet. For example, they could include a few key solved problems on it to use as guides to solving the exam questions. Also it can create an uneven playing field. Is the purpose of the exam to determine who has learned how to solve the problems at hand, or who can make the most helpful cheat sheet?\nAn extreme version of the cheat sheet is an open-book exam. One problem I’ve seen with this is that the instructor often feels they need to make the exam problems much more difficult since the students will have access to the book. As such, the students may not have practiced solving problems with a difficulty level that high. A second problem I’ve seen is that some students don’t study as hard for an open book exam. As a consequence, some spend more time paging through the book than they do showing what they know.\nI don’t claim to have the answer, but here’s what I do. Before the course begins, I compile a course equation summary that includes most of the equations that are used over the course of the semester. It’s typically 3 pages long. The equations are in groups (in my case, thermo equations, reactor design equations, etc.), but they are not individually identified. By not identifying the individual equations, it becomes necessary for the students to be able to pick out which one they need for a particular problem. I feel that having the ability to do so shows some level of understanding of the subject.\nAs an example, in my course a large number of the problems involve one of four types of reactors. The equations used to model each type of reactor are slightly different from each other. Thus, when an exam question involves one specific type of reactor, the students still need to be able to pick out the equations for that reactor type from among those for all the other reactor types. In other words, it requires a little bit of familiarity with the equations that typically comes from having practiced solving problems before the exam.\nI give them the equation summary on day one of the course. I encourage them to use it, and not the book or notes or whatever, when solving problems in class and for homework. I promise them that the exact same equation summary will be included as part of every exam. In this way, they gain familiarity with the equation summary prior to the exam.\nIn the end, I think the equation summary, the cheat sheet, or (to a lesser extent the open book) are all better than forcing students to memorize equations. To me, it is more important that they know which equation to use in a given problem-solving context and how to use it than to have memorized it. I’d rather they spend their exam preparation time practicing those skills instead of memorizing equations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "ToTaL PS is a blog I created to share my “Thoughts on Teaching and Learning Problem-Solving,” (ToTaL PS). “Problem-Solving” can have multiple meanings. Here the focus is actually on undergraduate college level science and engineering problem-solving courses. For the purposes of this blog, these are courses where the professor presents theory and equations and shows how to use the theory and apply the equations to explain and predict how some physical system performs. Most, if not all, of the student learning outcomes for this type of problem-solving course center on the learner being able to use the theory and equations to answer questions about the performance of systems to which they apply.\nThe problems in these courses are often referred to as “word problems” or “story problems.” Typically they consist of a few paragraphs that describe a system and provide information about how it is being operated. Then they ask one or more questions about how the system performs or how the system should be operated to achieve some desired performance. The problems can be classified as response, optimization or design problems. In a response problem the system and the way it is operated are specified and the question asks the student to determine the value of a specific input, output or system parameter. Optimization problems typically involve questions asking for specification of one or more system properties or operating parameters that maximize or minimize some other specified system output or response. Design problems differ in that they allow the problem-solver to make choices about one or more system properties or operating parameters with the goal of achieving or optimizing a specified system response. Optimization and design problems may also be constrained. In a constrained problem restrictions are placed upon the allowed answers to the questions being asked. Problems can also be classified as being open-ended or not. An open-ended problem has more than one “correct” answer. Design problems are open-ended, and optimization problems can be. In contrast, a problem that is not open-ended has a single answer that is correct. Most response problems are not open-ended.\nAnother characteristic of the kind of problem-solving courses that this blog focuses upon is that the students are assigned homework problems or sets of homework problems. In principle, these homework problems align with the course learning objectives. That is, when a learner can solve one of these problems correctly, it is an indicator that the learner has fulfilled one of the course learning objectives. Beyond homework problems, problem-solving courses very often use exams to evaluate the degree to which students have achieved the course learning objectives. As with homework problems, the problems included in exams typically align with the course learning objectives.\nI have been teaching problem-solving courses like the one I’ve described here since 1980. Before that, I was a student in many problem-solving courses. Over the years I’ve used different course structures, teaching methods, modes of evaluation, etc. Some of them worked and some didn’t. I’ve also used different approaches to learn myself, and observed students using a variety of learning approaches. Again, some learing strategies are more effective than others.\nIn more recent years, I’ve done some applied research on teaching and learning in problem-solving courses. So I decided to start this blog as a place where I can share my thoughts and experiences in case someone might be interested. I expect that most posts will be introduced from an instructor’s perspective, but I intend to discuss them from the perspectives of learners and instructors. Hopefully there will be some useful, or at least thought-provoking, information for both."

    "title": "Practice? Practice What?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "OK, practice is an important aspect of learning, but in a problem-solving context, what needs to be practiced? To paraphrase one of the seven principles of learning1 in the context of a problem-solving course: to develop problem-solving mastery, students must acquire component skills and knowledge, practice integrating them and know when to apply what they have learned.\nSo, a prerequisite to developing problem-solving mastery is the acquisition of component skills and knowledge. The are several kinds of “component skills and knowledge” that are necessary. One is a knowledge of definitions of terms associated with the problem type. Another is familiarity with the equations used when solving the problem type. If the students are required to memorize them, that is part of the component knowledge; if not, the ability to identify them is necessary. The component knowledge also includes understanding the assumptions that are inherent in the equations used to solve the problem type. Most problem-solving courses have pre-requisite coursework. Equations, definitions, etc. from pre-requisite courses that may be used for solving the problem type are also included in the component knowledge. In most cases, knowing how to perform the mathematics and/or write the computer code for solving the problem type is a component skill. Simplification of the equations (elimination of neglible terms, etc.) is another component skill.\nAll of those component skills and knowledge are fairly obvious. There are two others that are not as obvious, and, unfortunately, they are often not taught in problem-solving courses. They relate to the last part of the learning principle: knowing when to apply what they have learned. Knowing how to identify each of the different problem types encountered in the course, and, having identified the type of a problem, knowing the general prodcedure that is followed when solving that type of problem are essential component knowledge items. As I said, they often are not taught, perhaps with the assumption that they will be learned when completing homework assignments. I believe that they should be presented at the same time the other forms of component skills and knowledge are presented, and they should be emphasized.\nAs an example, in one problem-solving course that I teach, there are five basic types of problems. The same general equations are used when solving four of the five problem types, but the equations are used in very different ways with very different objectives. When I present each of the five basic problem types, I talk about how that type of problem can be identified and I list a set of distinguishing characteristics that can be used to differentiate that type of problem from other types of problems. I follow that immediately with a description of the general steps that need to be taken when solving that type of problem.\nNext, when I present examples of solving that type of problem, I try to always start by explaining how I identified the problem type and knew what to do to solve it. As an instructor, it is easy to leave this out because being an expert in the subject, the instructor does this almost sub-consciously. It is a form of “instructor blind spot” where something is so obvious to the instructor that they don’t mention it, forgetting that it is not necessarily obvious at all to a student. The same problem exists in the examples presented in many textbooks. After presenting the assignment, they jump immediately into the solution and never mention how one would know where or how to start.\nThe problem is exacerbated by the general structure of courses and textbooks. Both tend to proceed sequentially from one type of problem to the next. When a student is assigned a homework problem, they never need to identify the type of problem involved because the assignment is associated to specific classes in the course and specific chapters in the book where that type of problem is presented. They know the problem type based on the chapter in the book it comes from or the classes they attended during the past week.\nIn contrast, it is not uncommon for exams to include more than one type of problem derived from different classes or book chapters. If students have not been taught how to identify a problem’s type and had an opportunity to practice it, the exam may be the first time they need to do so.\nA similar issue is associated with knowing the general procedure used to solve a given type of problem. A student may understand everything that the instructor presents in class while solving a given problem type. Most students probably won’t even realize that the instructor never explained how they (the instructor) knew what to do. Later, when they are assigned that type of problem to complete for homework, they may realize after reading the problem statement that they don’t know where to start or how to proceed. To find out, they likely will look back at class notes or textbook examples and see what steps the expert took when solving the problem, and they will take the same steps.\nI refer to this as the mimicry approach to solving problems. One issue with this approach is that they are practicing solving problems using available solutions as a “recipe.” Eventually, after solving enough problems of a given type, the student will associate the recipe with the problem type, but not through a conscious effort to do so. A more efficient and effective approach is to explicitly tell the students that they need to know the “recipe” for each type of problem they will solve and to teach them that recipe. That is, to make sure they understand that the “recipe” is an important part of the component knowledge they must consciously acquire in order to become a proficient problem-solver.\nSo what does needs to be practiced in a problem-solving course? First students need to practice identifying a problem’s type, and to do that they first must have acquired the knowledge of how to identify a problem’s type. Second, students need to practice knowing which of the component skills and knowledge that they have acquired are needed for solving a particular problem type. Again, the general approach for solving a particular type of problem should be part of that previously-acquired component knowledge. Finally students need to practice actually using their knowledge and skills to solve problems.\nPutting it differently, students won’t automatically know when to apply each bit of knowledge they have acquired. Instructors can help them by teaching them how to identify different problem types and a general approach for each problem type that inchldes which bits of knowledge are needed and how to use them. Instructors can further help students by giving them opportunities to practice all of these things."
