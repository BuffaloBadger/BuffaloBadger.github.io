    "text": "Hi! My name is Carl Lund. I’m a Wisconsin Badger fan and UW Chemical Engineering alum living in Buffalo, NY. I’m also a professor of Chemical Engineering at the University at Buffalo. One of the courses I teach is an undergraduate course on chemical kinetics and reaction engineering. It’s a typical engineering problem-solving course that I’ve been teaching since 1986. During that time, I’ve revised and refined the methods I use when teaching it, trying to make student learning easier and more efficient.\nThinking that perhaps my thoughts and experiences over the 35-plus years I’ve been teaching problem-solving courses might be useful to others who do the same, I decided to blog about it. So this site is the home of the BuffaloBadger’s ToTaL PS blog. “ToTaL PS” stands for Thoughts on Teaching and Learning Problem Solving, and I’m the BuffaloBadger.\nYears ago I created a site with resources for the kinetics and reaction engineering course I teach. I’m now about half way through the process of creating a book based on those materials. The book will be titled Reaction Engineering Basics. When it gets closer to being completed, I will add it to this site. At present there is only a placeholder page for it.\nAfter I complete Reaction Engineering Basics, I plan to create an online self-study course based upon it. When it is ready, it will be added to this site, too.\nHope you get inspired or learn something while visiting here!\nHorns Up and On Wisconsin!"

    "text": "This page is a placeholder.\nReaction Engineering Basics is a book I am writing. When it gets closer to being finished, this page will be taken down, and the link you followed to get here will instead take you to the actual book.\nIn the mean time, here’s an excerpt from the Preface and the Table of Contents:\n\n\n\n\nReaction Engineering Basics is an introductory textbook on chemical kinetics and reaction engineering. There are many excellent introductory kinetics and reaction engineering textbooks. Like many other textbooks, Reaction Engineering Basics, limits kinetics data analysis problems to isothermal systems with a single reaction taking place (though it does not limit the analysis to systems where linear least squares can be used). However, as it moves into the area of reaction engineering, Reaction Engineering Basics is different from many other textbooks in two respects. First, Reaction Engineering Basics does not start with systems with single reactions taking place in isothermal reactors and then introduce systems with multiple reactions or systems requiring an energy balance in subsequent chapters. The reaction engineering section of Reaction Engineering Basics starts with systems that require mole and energy balances and that feature multiple reactions. Second, Reaction Engineering Basics differs from many other introductory kinetics and reaction engineering textbooks by using numerical methods to solve almost all of the problems it presents. The one exception is that analytic algebra is used when generating rate expressions for non-elementary reactions from proposed mechanisms for those reactions.\nReaction Engineering Basics was written for use in an undergraduate chemical engineering curriculum. The intended audience is students who have completed approximately two years of a four-year chemical engineering degree program. While very brief overviews of important topics are included, generally Reaction Engineering Basics assumes that readers have completed two semesters of general chemistry, a course on chemical engineering mass and energy balances and, ideally, a course on chemical engineering thermodynamics. Proficiency in algebra, calculus and differential equations is also assumed.\n\n\nPreface\nBasic Information\n\\(\\quad\\) 1. Reactions, Reactors and Reaction Engineering\n\\(\\quad\\) 2.

    "title": "Book Review: How Learning Works",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2013 I attended a conference on the future of engineering education. It brought together a number of engineering professors who were interested in improving the way engineers are educated in the U. S. I have the sense that like me, most in attendance did not have any formal training in education. One of the speakers noted that he, too, began conducting education research with no formal training in education. He said that a book by Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro, Lovett and Norman was tremendously helpful when he was getting started. That book is “How Learning Works, 7 Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching1.”\n“How Learning Works, 7 Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching” provides a nice summary of research related to how people learn. It is conveniently organized, starting with an introduction where the authors present seven principles of how people learn that have emerged from decades of research on the topic. The principles are (1) students’ prior learning can help or hinder learning, (2) how students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know, (3) students’ motivation generates, directs and sustains what they do to learn, (4) to develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them and know when to apply what they have learned, (5) goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning, (6) students’ current level of development interacts with the social, emotional and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning, and (7) to become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.\nThat introductory chapter is followed by seven chapters that each focus on one of the seven principles I just listed. These seven chapters are all structured the same way. They begin with two short vignettes. In each vignette a professor describes something they experienced in an actual classroom. The chapter then proceeds to analyze what was going on in each vignette, showing how that chapter’s learning principle applies. A nice summary of related research literature and findings that support the principle follows. Each of these chapters next presents strategies, based on that literature, that might be used in the situations described in the vignettes. Each of these chapters concludes with a summary. Following the seven chapters focused on the learning principles, an overall conclusion is presented.\nThe back portion of the book has eight appendices and a comprehensive list of references. The appendices describe things that might help address an issue related to one of the learning principles. They all begin with “What is,” or “What are.” For example, Appendix F is titled “What are Exam Wrappers and How Can We Use Them.” The subjects of the other appendices are student self-assessment, concept maps, rubrics, learning objectives, ground rules, checklists and reader response/peer review.\nI have found myself going back to this book repeatedly since I first read it. I highly recommend “How Learning Works.” You don’t need to be an educational specialist to read and understand it. It’s a great and accessible way for teachers and students alike to broaden their understanding of how learning works."

    "title": "Achievement Goals",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this post, I’d like to build on the suggestion in my last post that the manner in which homework is presented can affect the way a student approaches completing the homework assignment. When a student undertakes a task, such as a homework assignment, there is something they hope to accomplish by completing it. The thing they hope to accomplish can be called an achievement goal. Achievement goal theory categorizes achievement goals, describes their origins, and explains their consequences. (Many good reviews on achievement goal theory are available, for example1 2.)\nAccording to achievement goal theory, students may hold one of four achievement goal orientations. These are called performance approach, mastery approach, performance avoidance and mastery avoidance goal orientations. A student with a performance approach goal orientation wants to demonstrate their ability. In the context of solving homework problems in an engineering problem-solving course, I believe that this translates to a goal of getting the correct answer. In contrast, a student holding a mastery approach goal orientation wants to develop their ability. In terms of solving homework problems, I think of this goal as wanting to know how to get the correct answer.\nA student holding a performance avoidance goal orientation approaches a task with the goal of not performing more poorly than others. In a problem-solving course this might translate to a goal of not getting the wrong answer. In my limited reading in the area, mastery avoidance goal orientations are not as well defined as the other orientaions. A mastery avoidance goal might be to avoid being unable to get the correct answer, but it also could mean completing a task to avoid losing the knowledge of how to get the correct answer.\nThe goal orientation that a student adopts has a direct impact upon the learning behaviors they exhibit. From a teaching perspective, it is desirable for students to adopt a mastery approach goal orientation. Students with a mastery approach goal orientation want to know what to do to solve a problem and they want to understand why they need to do it. Understanding why they perform a given sequence of steps to solve a problem is expected to lead to more persistent knowledge, and it is expected to be more easily transferrable to solving future problems.\nStudents who adopt a performace approach goal orientation may exhibit less desirable learning behaviors because their goal is focused upon the answer and not the path to the answer. For example, a student with a performance approach goal orientation may be more likely to employ a mimicry approach to problem solving. They find a solved problem that appears to be similar to the problem at hand and then mimick the approach used to solve that problem. If the goal is getting the correct answer, this is the most efficient route, short of copying. Over time as more and more problems are solved, these students will know how to solve the type of problem at hand. However, it is not an efficient approach to developing understanding.\nAnother undesirable learning behavior that can result from a performance approach goal orientation is not using feedback. Feedback is provided after the student has either demonstrated they can get the correct answer or failed to do so. In terms of their goal, reading comments on their work or comparing their solution to one that is correct won’t change their goal outcome. Similarly, students who adopt a performance avoidance goal orientation may compare their solution to a correct one, but in doing so, they are often looking for places where they can “get a few points back,” and not looking to understand what they did wrong.\nSo in this post I’ve described some relationships between a student’s achievement goal orientation and the learning behaviors they display. I noted that the achievement goal orientation they hold may affect how they approach doing their homework assignments. This was necessary before I can talk about how the manner in which homework is presented can affect their approach. That will be my next topic, but here’s a brief preview. In their courses, students perceive a course goal structure with the same four types of goals. The course environment, e. g. the way homework is presented, influences the goal structure they perceive which affects the goal orientation they adopt which impacts the learning behaviors they employ."

    "title": "What is the Purpose of Homework?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s been a long time since I was a student in an engineering problem-solving course. I do remember that I was assigned a lot of homework problems, but I don’t recall spending any time consciously thinking about what its purpose was. The professor assigned it, and the score that I earned by submitting it represented some fraction of my final grade in the course. I don’t reccollect any of my professors ever telling me what was the purpose of the homework they assigned. (Some of them may have done so; if they did it went in one ear and out the other.) Reflecting back to those times, I believe that subconsciously I figured that the purpose of homework was to show the professor that I could solve the problems they assigned. In other words, I pretty much considered homework to be a form of evaluation or assessment of my learning.\nThere are at least three problems with that mind-set. First, my goal when solving the problems was to get the correct answer because that was the basis upon which the homework was graded. I was a student before the internet existed, so I couldn’t go online hoping to find the solution to the problem to make sure I got it right. Some fraternities and sororities on campus had files of old exam and homework solutions, but I didn’t have access to any of those, either. So I pretty much ended up solving the problems myself, but when I was done, I’m quite certain that I checked with classmates to see if they got the same answer, and if they didn’t, we’d sit down and try to determine which of us was correct and then revise the incorrect solution.\nI’m very confident that when I solved those problems, I did so primarily by mimicry. That is, I found an example that was solved in the textbook or my class notes, and then I mimicked that solution to get an answer to the problem I’d been assigned. In short, and in part because my goal was to get the correct answer, the second problem with my mindset on the purpose of homework was that I missed opportunities to expand or deepen my knowledge through solving the problems independently. More critically I missed the opportunity to develop my independent problem-solving skills. Those skills evolved gradually, as over time I started to remember how the problems were solved in the solutions I mimicked. It certainly wasn’t the most efficient way to learn how to solve the problems.\nThe third problem relates to feedback. Now to be honest, not much feedback was actually provided. Most of the time, a “correct” solution was posted somewhere (again, pre-internet, so probably inside some glass enclosed bulletin board), and my returned homework may have had some marks. Usually, though the marks were simply a red “X” through an equation or value that was incorrect. It didn’t really matter that much, though, because with my perspective on the purpose of homework (show the professor I could solve the problems they assigned), checking my solution came after the fact and wouldn’t change the result. I think I usually checked “to see what I got wrong” in the hope that I’d remember it when exam time came and not make the same mistake. I didn’t engage in any metacognitive thinking, though, to try to identify flaws in my study habits or to consider whether I knew how to approach the problem. As I said, I solved the problem by mimicry, so the approach I used wasn’t really mine, anyway.\nThe point of this post isn’t to reveal the purpose of homework in a problem-solving course. Homework can serve several purposes. The point is that the purpose for the homework that I (mostly subconsciously) inferred had a significant influence on the methods I used to solve the problem. My next few posts will take a closer look at how the way homework is presented can affect the way students approach it."

    "title": "ToTaL PS, What’s it all about?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "ToTaL PS is a blog I created to share my “Thoughts on Teaching and Learning Problem-Solving,” (ToTaL PS). “Problem-Solving” can have multiple meanings. Here the focus is actually on undergraduate college level science and engineering problem-solving courses. For the purposes of this blog, these are courses where the professor presents theory and equations and shows how to use the theory and apply the equations to explain and predict how some physical system performs. Most, if not all, of the student learning outcomes for this type of problem-solving course center on the learner being able to use the theory and equations to answer questions about the performance of systems to which they apply.\nThe problems in these courses are often referred to as “word problems” or “story problems.” Typically they consist of a few paragraphs that describe a system and provide information about how it is being operated. Then they ask one or more questions about how the system performs or how the system should be operated to achieve some desired performance. The problems can be classified as response, optimization or design problems. In a response problem the system and the way it is operated are specified and the question asks the student to determine the value of a specific input, output or system parameter. Optimization problems typically involve questions asking for specification of one or more system properties or operating parameters that maximize or minimize some other specified system output or response. Design problems differ in that they allow the problem-solver to make choices about one or more system properties or operating parameters with the goal of achieving or optimizing a specified system response. Optimization and design problems may also be constrained. In a constrained problem restrictions are placed upon the allowed answers to the questions being asked. Problems can also be classified as being open-ended or not. An open-ended problem has more than one “correct” answer. Design problems are open-ended, and optimization problems can be. In contrast, a problem that is not open-ended has a single answer that is correct. Most response problems are not open-ended.\nAnother characteristic of the kind of problem-solving courses that this blog focuses upon is that the students are assigned homework problems or sets of homework problems. In principle, these homework problems align with the course learning objectives. That is, when a learner can solve one of these problems correctly, it is an indicator that the learner has fulfilled one of the course learning objectives. Beyond homework problems, problem-solving courses very often use exams to evaluate the degree to which students have achieved the course learning objectives. As with homework problems, the problems included in exams typically align with the course learning objectives.\nI have been teaching problem-solving courses like the one I’ve described here since 1980. Before that, I was a student in many problem-solving courses. Over the years I’ve used different course structures, teaching methods, modes of evaluation, etc. Some of them worked and some didn’t. I’ve also used different approaches to learn myself, and observed students using a variety of learning approaches. Again, some learing strategies are more effective than others.\nIn more recent years, I’ve done some applied research on teaching and learning in problem-solving courses. So I decided to start this blog as a place where I can share my thoughts and experiences in case someone might be interested. I expect that most posts will be introduced from an instructor’s perspective, but I intend to discuss them from the perspectives of learners and instructors. Hopefully there will be some useful, or at least thought-provoking, information for both."

    "title": "Goal Structure",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In my July 3, 2023 post I suggested that the manner in which homework is presented can affect the way a student approaches completing a problem-solving assignment. Then in my July 18, 2023 post I described four goal orientations that influence the manner in which a student completes a problem-solving assignment. I described four achievement goal orientations that students may hold. Students with a performance approach goal orientation seek to demonstrate their ability. In problem-solving this can translate getting the correct answer being the goal. Learners with a mastery approach goal orientation seek to develop their ability. In problem-solving this can translate to knowing how to solve the problem. Students with a performance avoidance goal orientation seek to avoid demonstrating their inability. In problem-solving this can again translate to getting the correct answer as the goal. Finally students with a mastery avoidance goal orientation seek to avoid missing an opportunity to develop their ability. In problem-solving this can translate to knowing how to solve every variant of a given type of problem.\nSo if a student’s goal orientation influences how they approach a problem-solving assignment, and if the manner in which homework is presented can affect the student’s approach, it remains to relate the manner in which homework is presented to the goal orientation a student adopts. That is where goal structure comes in. In a nutshell, through their experiences in a course, students perceive a course goal structure. Perceived goal structure parallels achievement goal orientation. Students will perceive a performance approach, mastery approach, performance avoidance, or mastery avoidance goal structure. The goal structure a student perceives in a given course influences the goal orientation they adopt, and as already discussed, this affects their approach to assignments in the course. I think it is important to notice that goal structure is a perception. Different students taking the same course may perceive different goal structures. In part, that is because no two students have the exact same experiences while taking a course.\nI tend to think about the linkages between what I do as an instructor and the extent to which the course learning objectives are met in terms of Figure 1. Starting with the instructor, shown in orange, I set the learning objectives for the course, and the manner in which I convey the information and teach the skills necessary to meet them clearly can affect the learning outcomes (how fully each student meets the objectives). I also play a role in establishing the course environment, and this is what I will focus on later in the post. However, it is critically important to recognize that I do not have exclusive control of either the course environment or the learning outcomes. There are many other factors that shape the course environment and learning outcomes.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Indirect linkage between teaching and learning outcomes.\n\n\nThe blue box in the figure is meant to convey that a student’s perception of the course goal structure and the goal orientation they adopt are internal to that student. I cannot change either of them directly. Instead, as the figure suggests, I can only try to establish a course environment that will be perceived as a mastery approach goal structure. I’ve already noted that each student’s goal orientation will affect the learning behaviors that they employ (right side of the figure). I can try to influence those learning behaviors (dashed orange arrow) by suggesting effective ways to study, etc. but ultimately learning behavior is under the student’s control. Again, there are a variety of other factors that will also impact the learning behaviors that the student ultimately employs. If I do a good job of conveying the necessary knowledge and skills and the student utilizes adaptive learning behaviors, the learning outcomes should meet or exceed the learning objectives.\nThis is the basis for my previous claim that the manner in which homework is presented can affect the way a student approaches completing a problem-solving activity. However, the way homework is presented is just one part of the course environment. If I alter the way I present homework assignments in ways suggesting a mastery approach goal structure, but every other aspect of the course environment suggests, for example, a performance approach goal structure, I can’t expect my alterations to be effective. It is necessary to holistically address the course environment if I hope to influence student goal orientations.\nBut for now, let’s just look at homework and how it is presented. The first thing to decide is what purpose or purposes you want the homework to serve. It is OK to use homework assignments as a means of assessing learning outcomes. I personally don’t think it is a very effective or accurate means of assessment, but as long as the students have opportunities to practice, fail and learn from their mistakes before being assessed, it is OK to use homework in this way. Students should be advised of the purpose of the assignment. I think many instructors think of homework as both a practice/learning activity and an assessment. If that’s the intended purpose, it is important to emphasize to the students that the homework is intended to be a practice/learning acitivty. To me this is a kind of mixed messaging that could result in a mastery-approach goal structure, but that is more likely to yield a performance approach goal structure.\nIn my problem-solving course the purpose of homework is completely for practice, learning, and self-assessment. I have found that if homework is optional, many students do not complete it. Therefore I “grade” homework assignments on effort and not on whether the correct answer was obtained. I give the solution to the problem to the students as a part of the assignment. I tell them to try to solve the problem as if they are taking an exam, and to only refer to the solution if they get stuck. They are instructed to compare their solution to the one I provided after they have completed the assignment to make sure they completed it correctly. I then ask them to write a brief reflection on the state of their understanding of that particular type of assignment and to identify things they can do if their understanding is not yet fully developed.\nI believe that taken together, this way of presenting homework sends a clear message that the purpose of homework is to learn how to solve problems. I often point out that if they know how to solve a problem, then they will get the correct answer, but if they get the correct answer by using non-adaptive learning behaviors, they may not know how to solve the problem independently. This presentation of homework is one of many things I do in my problem-solving course to try to establish a course environment that is perceived by students as a mastery-approach goal structure."
