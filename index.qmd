[*Reaction Engineering Basics*](http://buffalobadger.github.io/RE_Basics) is a book I am writing for use in the undergraduate kinetics and reaction engineering course I teach. Everything for which a first draft has been completed is available via this link. As drafts of missing chapters are completed, they will be added. Once I have completed first drafts of all of the chapters and appendices, I will do a final revision and proofreading. At that point I will add the capability for readers to report errors.
